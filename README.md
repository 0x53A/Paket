F# ProjectScaffold
=======================

A prototypical .NET solution (file system layout and tooling), recommended by the F# Foundation.

This scaffolding can be used to generate the suggested structure of a typical F# library.
_(NOTE: this layout needs adjusting when authoring a Type Provider. In that case you should use a separate Tests solution)_
