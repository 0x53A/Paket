# ProjectScaffold

A prototypical .NET solution including file system layout and tooling, recommended by the F# Foundation.

This scaffolding can be used to generate the suggested structure of a typical F# library.
_(NOTE: this layout needs adjusting when authoring a Type Provider. In that case you should use a separate Tests solution)_ 

In order to start the scaffolding process run 

    $ build.cmd // on windows    
    $ build.sh  // on mono
