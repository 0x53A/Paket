# Testimonials and Quotes

## GROSSWEBER

<blockquote><p>Paket solves dependency resolution very elegantly.</p></blockquote>

We at [GROSSWEBER](http://grossweber.com/en) are fans of command line tools that serve a single purpose, like [git](http://grossweber.com/git). Paket is such a tool that works extremely well when compared to other solutions available on the .NET platform. We use Paket not only to manage dependencies, but also to create our own NuGet packages. All in an easy-to-use, consistent, reliable and fast way. Anybody who has been working with dependency managers on other platforms like npm, bundler and pip will be pleased to find a similar workflow with Paket.

We love what we do and with love comes passion. This passion drives us to actively engage in our client projects and to design and develop as if they were our own. Spreading the word about Paket in our [trainings](http://grossweber.com/trainings) comes naturally.

> Paket has removed the pain from disciplined dependency management.

[15below](http://15below.com) started moving from copying binary dependencies around to nuget dependencies several years ago, and it's been a massive help with our internal coding discipline. But the time overheads added to development by versioned path merge conflicts and the confusion caused by multiple versions within solutions was becoming more and more of a pain point. It reached the stage where we were considering moving back to a method of working we knew was less efficient just to avoid the pain of the tooling.

Paket has removed the pain from disciplined dependency management. Sensible design for large, shared projects protects us from insane merge conflicts and on the few occasions that we have discovered bugs or missing features the clean codebase and responsive maintainers have enabled us to fill those gaps rapidly - often with a new release the same day.
