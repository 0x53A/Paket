# What is Paket?

Paket is a dependency manager for .NET and [Mono][mono] projects, which is designed to work well with [NuGet][nuget] packages and also enables [referencing files directly from GitHub repositories](http-dependencies.html).
It enables precise and predictable control over what packages the projects within your application reference. More details are in the [FAQ](faq.html).
If you are already using NuGet for package restore in your solution then you can learn about the upgrade process in the [convert from NuGet](paket-convert-from-nuget.html) section.
