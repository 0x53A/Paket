# What is Paket?

Paket is a dependency manager for .NET and [Mono][mono] projects, which is designed to work well with [NuGet][nuget] packages and also enables [referencing files directly from GitHub repositories](github-dependencies.html).
It enables precise and predictable control over what packages the projects within your application reference. More details are in the [FAQ](faq.html).

## How to get Paket

Paket is available for [download from GitHub.com](https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/releases/latest). It's also available as a NuGet package, `Paket`: [![NuGet Status](http://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Paket.svg?style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Paket/) See [Release notes](https://github.com/fsprojects/Paket/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES.txt) for history.

If you are already using NuGet for package restore in your solution then you can learn about the upgrade process in the [convert from NuGet](convert-from-nuget.html) section.

## Getting Started

Specify the version rules of all dependencies used in your application in a [`paket.dependencies` file](dependencies-file.html) in your project's root:

    source http://nuget.org/api/v2

    nuget Castle.Windsor-log4net ~> 3.2
    nuget Rx-Main ~> 2.0

Install all of the required packages from the specified sources:

    [lang=batchfile]
    $ paket install

The [`paket install` command](paket-install.html) will analyze your [`paket.dependencies` file](dependencies-file.html) and generate a [`paket.lock` file](lock-file.html) alongside it.
If the lock file already exists, it will not be regenerated by an `install`.

You can place [`paket.references` files](references-files.html) alongside your Visual Studio projects to have Paket automatically sync references for the packages noted in that file whenever an `install` or `update` takes place.

All of the files involved (the [`paket.dependencies`](dependencies-file.html) and [`paket.lock`](lock-file.html) in the root, and the [`paket.references`](references-files.html) files for each project) should be committed to your version control system.

Determine if there are package updates available:

    [lang=batchfile]
    $ paket outdated

Download updated packages; update [`paket.lock` file](lock-file.html) and re-install to reflect and changes:

    [lang=batchfile]
    $ paket update

The [`paket update` command](paket-update.html) will analyze your [`paket.dependencies` file](dependencies-file.html), and update the [`paket.lock` file](lock-file.html).
